set up a router folder. It will make sure that all your data in yours server.js file is neat.
to call the router folder you have to place module.exports = router at the bottom of the router file.

in the ejs file: if you use <%= '' %> whatever is inside will be output to page.
if you use <%  %> it won't be output to page.
if you use <%-  %> this is for raw html

router.get('/:id' , async (req, res) => {
    const article = await Article.findById(req.params.id) --find article by id
    if (article = null)  res.redirect('/)
    res.render('articles/show', {article: article}) 
})




slugify is a program that turns id's into words
